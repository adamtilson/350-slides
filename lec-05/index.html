    ## Invariant
    - The invariant is some property of the system which is true in the start state of the system, and true in every legal move. 
    - We can use this to prove if the system is in a winnable state, or an unwinnable state.

    ### Strong Induction Comparison
    - Last class we say: Solve a Tougher Problem
    - We can also use a stronger form of induction

    Ordinary Induction:
    
    $\dfrac{P(0), \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)}{\forall m \in \mathbb{N}, P(m)}$
    
    Strong Induction:
    
    $\dfrac{P(0), \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(0) \wedge P(1) \wedge P(2) \wedge ... \wedge P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)}{\forall m \in \mathbb{N}, P(m)}$

    ???
    Which problem did we look at that would have been solved by strong induction?

    ---

    ### When to use Strong Induction
    When to use strong induction
    - When there is no obvious connection between $P(n)$ and $P(n+1)$
    - i.e. we can't use $P(n)$ directly to prove $P(n+1)$
    - However, we may be able to use some combination of $P(0), P(1), P(2) ... P(N)$

    ---

    ### How to use Strong Induction: Proof Template
    - State that we are solving the problem by strong induction
    - Define our Induction Hypothesis, $P(n)$, defining the induction variable $n$
    - Prove the base case: $P(0)$ is true
    - Prove the inductive step: $P(0) \wedge P(1) \wedge P(2) \wedge ... \wedge P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)$
    - By induction, conclude P(n) is true for all $n \in \mathbb{D}$

    ---
    ### Well-Ordering Principle
    The well-ordering principle states that:
    - every nonempty set 
    - of non-negative integers 
    - has a smallest element
    This seems very obvious, but can actually be used to formulate some powerful proofs.
    ---
    ### Well-Ordering Principle Common Template
    - Define the set C, of counter-examples to P being true
    - $C := {n \in \mathbb{N}, \neg P(n)}$
    - Proof by contradiction
      - Assume that $C$ is non-empty
      - By the well-ordering principle, show that $C$ contains a smallest element, $n$, and thus is non-empty
      - Reach a contradiction (open ended)
      - e.g. show that $n \not\in C$
      - Conclude that C must be empty
    ---
    ### Well-Ordering Principle - Another Formulation
    - Goal: prove some $P(n)$ is FALSE
    - Define the set $S$, of examples for which $P(n)$ is true
    - By the well-ordering principle, define $s$ as the lowest element in $S$
    - Proof by contradiction
      - Show that a value smaller than $s$ satisfies $P(n)$
      - Thus that value is also in $S$
      - Thus $s$ was not the lowest value in $S$
        - Contradiction
      - By the well-ordering principle, $S$ must be empty

    ---
    Examples:
    We already used the Well-Ordering principle when we proved $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational!
    - Recall we defined rational numbers as the fraction of two integers in smallest terms
      - 
    - We then showed that each of these numbers was even, meaning there must be a smaller term
    - Thus, by the well ordering principle

    Any amount of money of least 8c can be made using 3c and 5c coins.
    - By strong induction
    - By Well-ordering Principle
